Eventually, this project will become a tool to generate [[http://www.winpilot.com/Default.aspx][WinPilot]] [[http://www.winpilot.com/UsersGuide/UserAirspace.asp][OpenAir™]]
automatically from the french [[https://www.sia.aviation-civile.gouv.fr/][SIA]] (Service de l’Information Aéronautique).

More precisely, I'll work with the eAIP published by the SIA. eAIP is the
EUROCONTROL Specification for the electronic Aeronautical Information
Publication: it covers the Aeronautical Information Publications (AIPs), AIP
Amendments (AMDTs), AIP Supplements (SUPs) and Aeronautical Information
Circulars (AICs).

Since this specification is shared by European countries, the tool will
certainly be usable to generate OpenAir files from other countries as well
(with small adaptation, surely).
